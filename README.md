# DataVisualisationLandscape

Create a 3D landscape using a csv file to load the virtual world.

This project is the result of an iLab that I undertook at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) in the Spring semester of 2016 whilst studying for my Masters of Data Science and Innovation.

It aims to explore how using gaming development technology can be repurposed to visualisation data in a way that can be experienced more interactively. 

The drive behind this is due to the advent of cheap and easily accessible 3D technology moving into the marketplace will allow virtual reality to move from the lounge room into the workplace. This will enable corporate users to better engage with their data to make better and more informed decisions.

Look at the screens shots folder to get an idea of what looking at data that has been materialised as physical objects.
